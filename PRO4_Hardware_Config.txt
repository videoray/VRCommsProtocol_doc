PRO4 Hardware config


Hardware Config is where model specific hardware data is stored.   Typically this is data such as individual part versions in a multi-part device, such as a PRO4 sub.

This data is stored in EEPROM after the bootloader information at:
0x0020 - 0x03ff Hardware Config


The PRO4 Hardware Config has the following packed structure:
uint32  DataStructVersionNumber
char    BOARD_REV_CPU[32]
char    BOARD_REV_POWER[32]
char    BOARD_REV_DEPTH[32]
char    BOARD_REV_CAMERA_IO[32]
char    DEVICE_REV_CAMERA[32]
char    DEVICE_REV_LIGHTS[32]
char    DEVICE_REV_THRUSTER_HORIZ[32]
char    DEVICE_REV_THRUSTER_VERT[32]

The first 4 bytes are the structure revision number.

This is essentially multiple fields of 32 characters each.  
Each field provides a revision number
for a component of the PRO4 ROV.
